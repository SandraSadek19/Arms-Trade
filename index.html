				<p class="intro"> Military spending reached records not seen before in 2023 as a result of increased conflicts around the world with the United States continuing to assert its dominance in the arms trade market.  
				</p>
				 <p>
				The U.S. remained at the top of the list for the highest military spending as well as the largest exporter of arms in the world. And with the incoming Trump presidency, experts predict an even larger push for weapons sales over the next four years. 
				</p>
				<p><q>Trump is all about the dollars, right? And so this is a commodity that he has in the past and will in the future look to capitalize on recklessly,</q> said Jeff Abramson, a senior fellow at the <a href="https://internationalpolicy.org/">Center for International Policy.</a></p>
				<p>In 2023 alone, the U.S. spent $916 billion on its military, according to the <a href="https://www.sipri.org/">Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI)</a>, an organization dedicated to research into conflict, armaments, arms control and disarmament. Trailing behind the U.S. is China, Russia, India and Saudi Arabia respectively, according to SIPRI.</p>

				<p>
				Experts attribute the rise in arms spending mainly to growing geopolitical tensions like the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, among others. 
				</p>
				<p>
				<q>If we think about U.S.-China relations, U.S.-Russia relations and what comes along with that, I think there's a lot of countries feeling a little nervous about where international politics is going,</q> said Jennifer Erickson, assistant professor of political science and international studies at Boston College. 
				</p>
				<p>
				Tracking arms sales can be tricky though, Erickson explained, due to the complex tactics employed by the government when trading with other countries. A lot of arms sales are gifted, loaned or sold at a price below market value. Sometimes, weapons are also offset which means additional technology might be transferred when a nation purchases a certain amount of weapons. 
				</p>
				<p>
				Abramson directs the <a href="https://www.forumarmstrade.org/">Forum on Arms Trade</a>, which tracks all notification of weapons sales by the U.S. government. But the various ways the U.S. weapons can be sold means tracking is limited. Direct commercial sales, approved through a state department license and less transparent, are slowing accounting for a majority of weapons sales compared to foreign government arms sales, Abramson said.
				</p>
				<p>
					<q>You might not be getting a full picture. And then things like what is happening with Ukraine are <a href="https://www.state.gov/use-of-presidential-drawdown-authority-for-military-assistance-for-ukraine/">presidential drawdowns,</a> which have not been used to this extent until recently. That's 10s of billions [of dollars]. So the picture of the U.S. arms sales or arms transfers is much larger than [official government sales],</q> he said.
				</p>
				<p>
				As the U.S. and Russia continue to compete in terms of arms trade, other players have thrown their hat in the game, developing new technologies and systems like drones in <a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2023/06/israel-records-12-5-billion-in-defense-exports-led-by-drones-air-defense/">Israel</a> and <a href="https://nordicmonitor.com/2024/07/turkey-plans-to-increase-drone-sales-to-african-countries-with-saudi-financing/">Turkey.</a> But most importantly, the arms trade will evolve based on whether non-U.S. allied countries will seek out U.S. weapons after Trump takes office. 
				</p>
				<p><q>There's a lot of talk about how countries in the Global South especially are trying to hedge their bets. They don't want to put all of their eggs in the U.S. basket or the China basket. They want to spread the risk around a little bit,</q> Erickson said. </p>
				<p>Among the largest importers of weapons in the world, India ranks first, receiving almost 10% of the entire global arms imports.</p>

				<p>With just 40 days until inauguration day, outstanding military allocations will be put on an accelerated timeline. That includes <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/06/biden-trump-ukraine-assistance-00187897">more than $6 billion in aid to Ukraine</a> that has yet to be sent out. Trump has vowed to end global wars around the world which has worried some in the defense industry about a dip in arms sales. However, Trump is unlikely to turn down a good deal, Abramson said. </p>
				<p><q>He's going to sell if someone's willing to buy. He's very transactional,</q> Abramson said.</p>
